# Policy version
# By default, checkpolicy will create the highest
# version policy it supports.  Setting this will
# override the version.  This only has an
# effect for monolithic policies.
#OUTPUT_POLICY = 33

# Policy Type
# standard, mls, mcs
TYPE = standard

# Policy Name
# If set, this will be used as the policy
# name.  Otherwise the policy type will be
# used for the name.
NAME = refpolicy

# Distribution
# Some distributions have portions of policy
# for programs or configurations specific to the
# distribution.  Setting this will enable options
# for the distribution.
# redhat, gentoo, debian, suse, and rhel4 are current options.
# Fedora users should enable redhat.
#DISTRO = redhat

# Unknown Permissions Handling
# The behavior for handling permissions defined in the
# kernel but missing from the policy.  The permissions
# can either be allowed, denied, or the policy loading
# can be rejected.
# allow, deny, and reject are current options.

# Direct admin init
# Setting this will allow sysadm to directly
# run init scripts, instead of requiring run_init.
# This is a build option, as role transitions do
# not work in conditional policy.

# Systemd
# Setting this will configure systemd as the init system.

# will build a monolithic policy.

# User-based access control (UBAC)

# build options.  Putting foo here will enable
# build option blocks named foo.  Options should be
# separated by spaces.
