Reference Policy has a requirement of checkpolicy 1.33.1 and
libsepol-1.16.2.  Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 and Fedora Core 4 RPMs
are available on the CLIP download page at http://oss.tresys.com,
and can be installed thusly:

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4:

	rpm -i libsepol-1.11.7-1.i386.rpm
	rpm -U checkpolicy-1.28-4.i386.rpm

Fedora Core 4:

	rpm -U libsepol-1.11.7-1.i386.rpm checkpolicy-1.28-4.i386.rpm

To install Reference Policy sources into /etc/selinux/refpolicy/src/policy:

	make install-src

This will back up a pre-existing source policy to the
/etc/selinux/refpolicy/src/policy.bak directory.

If you do not have a modules.conf, one can be generated:

	make conf

This will create a default modules.conf.  Options for the policy
build process can be found in build.conf.  After installing the policy sources,
the old Make targets have been maintained for the monolithic policy:

Local policy development:

	make policy

Compile and install the policy:

	make install

Compile, install, and load the policy:

	make load

Filesystem labeling:

	make relabel
	make checklabels
	make restorelabels

See the README for more information on available make targets.
