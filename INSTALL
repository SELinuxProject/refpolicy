Reference Policy has the following build requirements:
	* libsepol 2.7
	* libsemanage 2.6
	* checkpolicy 2.6
	* policycoreutils 2.6
	* Python >= 3.4
	* GCC

To install Reference Policy sources into /etc/selinux/refpolicy/src/policy:

	make install-src

This will back up a pre-existing source policy to the
/etc/selinux/refpolicy/src/policy.bak directory.

If you do not have a modules.conf, one can be generated:

	make conf

This will create a default modules.conf.  Options for the policy
build process can be found in build.conf.  After installing the policy sources,
the old Make targets have been maintained for the monolithic policy:

Local policy development:

	make policy

Compile and install the policy:

	make install

Compile, install, and load the policy:

	make load

Filesystem labeling:

	make relabel
	make checklabels
	make restorelabels

See the README for more information on available make targets.
