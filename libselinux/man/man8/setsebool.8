setsebool \- set SELinux boolean value

.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B setsebool
.I "[ -P ] boolean value | bool1=val1 bool2=val2 ..."

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.B setsebool 
sets the current state of a particular SELinux boolean or a list of booleans 
to a given value. The value may be 1 or true to enable the boolean, or 0 or 
false to disable it. 

Without the -P option, only the current boolean value is 
affected; the boot-time default settings defined by
.I /etc/selinux/SELINUXTYPE/booleans
are not changed. 

If the -P option is given, all pending values are written to
the boolean file on disk.
