<h1>Switching to Targeted Reference Policy</h1>
<p>
	This guide will walk you through switching to the targeted reference
	policy on a Fedora system.
<p>
<h2>
	Download and unpack the policy
</h2>
<p>
	The policy is <a href="index.php?page=download">available</a>
	from Sourceforge.  Download the policy, and unpack it to a temporary
	directory.  Then use the install-src make target to install the policy
	sources.
</p>
<div id="codeblock">
<pre>
# <b>tar -jxvf refpolicy-20050802.tar.bz2 -C /tmp</b>
# <b>cd /tmp/refpolicy</b>
# <b>make install-src</b>
</pre>
</div>
<h2>
	Configure the policy
</h2>
<p>
	The policy source is found in the
	/etc/selinux/refpolicy/src/policy/ directory.
	Use the example targeted modules configuration.
</p>
<div id="codeblock">
<pre>
# <b>cd /etc/selinux/refpolicy/src/policy</b>
# <b>cp policy/modules.conf.targeted_example policy/modules.conf</b>
</pre>
</div>
<p>
	Edit the policy Makefile (/etc/selinux/refpolicy/src/policy/Makefile).
	Near the top of the file, the policy has a few build options.
	The TYPE needs to be set to targeted, and the DISTRO option needs to be
	uncommented and set to redhat.
</p>

#
# Configurable portions of the Makefile
#

# Policy version
# By default, checkpolicy will create the highest
# version policy it supports.  Setting this will
# override the version.
#OUTPUT_POLICY = 18

# Policy Type
# strict, targeted, strict-mls, targeted-mls
TYPE = <font color=red><b>targeted</b></font>

# Policy Name
# If set, this will be used as the policy
# name.  Otherwise the policy type will be
# used for the name.
NAME = refpolicy

# Distribution
# Some distributions have portions of policy
# for programs or configurations specific to the
# distribution.  Setting this will enable options
# for the distribution.
# redhat, gentoo, debian, and suse are current options.
# Fedora users should enable redhat.
<font color=red><b>DISTRO = redhat</b></font>

# Build monolithic policy.  Putting n here
# will build a loadable module policy.
# Only monolithic policies are currently supported.
MONOLITHIC=y

# Uncomment this to disable command echoing
#QUIET:=@
</pre>
</div>
<h2>
	Install the policy
</h2>
<p>
	Next, install the policy, application configuration files, and
	file contexts.
</p>
<div id="codeblock">
<pre>
# <b>make install</b>
</pre>
</div>
<h2>
	Change SELinux Configuration
</h2>
<p>
	Modify the /etc/selinux/config file, and set SELINUXTYPE to refpolicy.
	It should look similar to this:
</p>
<div id="codeblock">
<pre>
# This file controls the state of SELinux on the system.
# SELINUX= can take one of these three values:
#       enforcing - SELinux security policy is enforced.
#       permissive - SELinux prints warnings instead of enforcing.
#       disabled - No SELinux policy is loaded.
SELINUX=enforcing
# SELINUXTYPE= can take one of these two values:
#       targeted - Only targeted network daemons are protected.
#       strict - Full SELinux protection.
SELINUXTYPE=<font color=red><b>refpolicy</b></font>
</pre>
</div>
<h2>
	Restart and Relabel
</h2>
<p>
	The system needs to be restarted with the new policy, and relabeled
	on booting, to finalize the switch.
</p>
<div id="codeblock">
<pre>
# <b>touch /.autorelabel</b>
# <b>shutdown -r now</b>
</pre>
</div>
