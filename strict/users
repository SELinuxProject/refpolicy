# User configuration.
#
# This file defines each user recognized by the system security policy.
# Only the user identities defined in this file may be used as the
# user attribute in a security context.
#
# Each user has a set of roles that may be entered by processes
# with the users identity.  The syntax of a user declaration is:
#
# 	user username roles role_set [ level default_level range allowed_range ];
#
# The MLS default level and allowed range should only be specified if 
# MLS was enabled in the policy.

#
# system_u is the user identity for system processes and objects.
# There should be no corresponding Unix user identity for system_u,
# and a user process should never be assigned the system_u user
# identity.
#
user system_u roles system_r;

#
# user_u is a generic user identity for Linux users who have no
# SELinux user identity defined.  The modified daemons will use
# this user identity in the security context if there is no matching
# SELinux user identity for a Linux user.  If you do not want to
# permit any access to such users, then remove this entry.
#
user user_u roles { user_r }; 

#
# The following users correspond to Unix identities.
# These identities are typically assigned as the user attribute
# when login starts the user shell.  Users with access to the sysadm_r
# role should use the staff_r role instead of the user_r role when
# not in the sysadm_r.
#

# The sysadm_r user also needs to be permitted system_r if we are to allow
# direct execution of daemons
user root roles { sysadm_r staff_r secadm_r ifdef(`direct_sysadm_daemon', `system_r') };

# sample for administrative user
#user jadmin roles { staff_r sysadm_r ifdef(`direct_sysadm_daemon', `system_r') };

# sample for regular user
#user jdoe roles { user_r };

#
# The following users correspond to special Unix identities
# 
ifdef(`nx_server.te', `
user nx roles nx_server_r;
